# lqr_solve
A C++ implementation to compute the LQR gain matrix for discrete time infinite horizon problems.
The theory behind it is well described on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-quadratic_regulator#Infinite-horizon.2C_discrete-time_LQR).
This code serves more as a template for your own implementation that as a fully developed feature.
